% nonLinspace(mn, mx, num, spacetype) returns a vector of non-linearly 
% spaced elements based on spacing specified by spacetype. 
%
% nonLinVec = nonLinspace(mn, mx, num, 'exp10') returns a vector of
% elements with smaller spacing at the beginning of the vector and greater
% spacing at the end of the vector based on the curve y = 10^x.
%
% nonLinVec = nonLinspace(mn, mx, num, 'cos') returns a vector of elements
% with smaller spacing at the beginning and end of the vector, and greater
% spacing in the middle based on the curve y = 1/2(1-cos(x)).
%
% nonLinVec = nonLinspace(mn, mx, num, 'log10') returns a vector of
% elements with greater spacing at the beginning of the vector and smaller
% spacing at the end of the vector. 
% 
%   Inputs: 
%       mn        - The minimum value in the vector. 
%       mx        - The maximum value in the vector.
%       num       - The number of elements in the vector. 
%       spacetype - Specifies the type of spacing needed. 
%
%   Outputs:
%       nonLinVec - A vector consisting of elements with spacing specified 
%                   by spacetype.

    % basic qualitative analysis, an exponentialliness of 20 seemed to be a
